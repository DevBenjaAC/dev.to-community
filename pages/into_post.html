                        <p class="card-text">The rise of chatGPT has pushed the question of AI taking over our jobs. The
                            tech industry is buzzing with the conversation, but will AI mean the end of all jobs for
                            humanity or some jobs?</p>
                        <p>To put this in perspective, we need to look at the projections of many experts.</p>

                        <p>Kai-Fu Lee, AI expert and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, wrote in his book <a
                                href="https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1536089703&amp;sr=8-1"
                                rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><u>AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New
                                    World Order</u></a> that 50% of all jobs will be automated in 15 years; this was in
                            2018.</p>

                        <p><a
                                href="https://kaifulee.medium.com/10-jobs-that-are-safe-in-an-ai-world-ec4c45523f4f">MIT</a>
                            researchers estimated Ai will wipe off over 2 million jobs in the market by 2025.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chatgpt-chat-ai-jobs-most-likely-to-be-replaced/"
                                    rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Cbsnews </a>gave a list of jobs that
                                would be most impacted, which is endless.</p>

                        <p>Would this lead to the end of human labour?</p>

                        <p>In the book <a
                                    href="https://www.amazon.com/2020s-FUTURE-BEYOND-Technologys-Disruption/dp/1652851771"
                                    >2020s and the future beyond</a>, the
                                author wrote "Battle Clash - Job Disrupting AI, Robots
                                Machines."From the knowledge doubling curve of Buckminster
                                Fuller, we see that the rate of change is exponential. In the 1900s, knowledge doubled
                                every century (i.e. every 100 years). By the 1960s, knowledge
                                doubled 25 years. 2020 knowledge doubled every 13 months.</p>

                        <p>According to IBM, it is estimated that knowledge will double every 12 hours in the
                                coming years.</p>

                        <p>It means everything you know will become old and irrelevant the next day. Can humanity
                                survive such a shift?</p>

                        <p>I decided to take this question to ChatGPT to mirror its opinion and see if it was
                                programmed to become the bridge on which humanity will be rendered jobless.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>Here are some specific jobs that AI will impact:</b></span></p>

                        <ol start="1">
                            <li>Data entry clerks</li>
                            <li>Telemarketers</li>
                            <li>Manufacturing assembly line workers</li>
                            <li>Cashiers</li>
                            <li>Bank tellers</li>
                            <li>Customer service representatives</li>
                            <li>Accounts payable/receivable clerks</li>
                            <li>Invoice processors</li>
                            <li>Medical coding and billing specialists</li>
                            <li>Radiology technologists</li>
                            <li>Legal document reviewers</li>
                            <li>Stock and commodities traders.</li>
                        </ol>

                

                        <p>I poked more with the estimated number of jobs Ai will take off, and while ChatGPT was
                                not forthcoming in giving me a number, it estimated the numbers were within 35 - 47% of
                                jobs worldwide.</p>

                        <p>While this might be gloomy, as the expected projections are very high, it also exposes
                                us to new jobs.</p>

                        <p>AI will bring roughly 97 million jobs to the US. While this needs to be verified, it is
                                difficult to predict the exact percentage of jobs that AI will create.</p>

                        <p>The impact of AI on employment will depend on many factors, including the speed of
                                technological advancements, economic conditions, and government policies.</p>

                        <p>AI can create new job opportunities in areas such as developing, deploying,
                                maintaining, and managing AI systems.</p>

                        <p>For example, the demand for workers with skills in machine learning, data analysis, and
                                software development is likely to increase as AI becomes more widespread.</p>

                        <p>However, the net impact of AI on employment will depend on the balance between jobs
                                lost to automation and those that AI creates.</p>

                        <p>Currently, most experts believe that AI will likely result in a net loss of jobs in the
                                short term but will also create new job opportunities in a long time.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that the impact of AI on employment will not be uniform across
                                all industries and regions.</p>

                                    rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">ChatGPT </a>is about to employ
                                hundreds of developers to improve chatGPT programming capability, making its answers
                                more precise and accurate.</p>

                        <p>The coming years would pioneer the next phase of the development of Ai.</p>

                        <p>Expected to be revolutionary, AI would open doors to innovation in medicine, space
                                exploration and food for humanity.</p>

                        <p>It would also become a tool used by the government to track, eliminate and fight each
                                other. What we see in Ukraine would be the tip of the iceberg as to what we can expect
                                to see in the coming years.</p>

                        <p>It would also herald the <a
                                    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/i6ztfh/singualarity/"
                                    rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">singularity</a>. A time when humans
                                will fuse with robots, where technology will be so advanced that flying robots will no
                                longer interest people as men would be in the phase of teleportation.</p>

                        <p>AI is alright, but the probability of it being used for sinister things by big
                                corporations and government officials is relatively high. It is the fear many are
                                currently having.</p>

                        <p>We can look back at the creation of the Atomic bomb; the horrors of Hiroshima and
                                Nagasaki will forever remain with us.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                        <p>What AI brings to the table is mind-blowing, and the jobs it will take will differ from
                                the ones it will get.</p>

                        <p>However, AI'sAI's power to cause global disruption is the biggest hindrance to its
                                acceptance; many believe some people will use it to create chaos.</p>

                        <p>While we watch closely, the future beckons us to see the world from the prism of
                                machines.</p>
